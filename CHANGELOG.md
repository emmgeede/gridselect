## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `gridselect(wrapper)` turns a native radio or checkbox group inside a
  wrapper into an instance. Same wrapper, same instance.
- `instance.value` reads and sets the selection: a string or `null` for
  radios, an array for checkboxes. Setting fires no event. Numbers
  match their string form, other types match nothing.
- `instance.destroy()`.
- Clear `TypeError`s for a missing element, mixed radios and checkboxes, and
  radios with different names. Warning for duplicate values.
- TypeScript declarations generated from JSDoc.
